Shane's Editor makes it possible to create content in VR using web technologies.

It supports many 3d shapes, a rich set of optimised prefab models built in and scripting in javascript.

The editor interface uses [aframe-material-collection](https://npmjs.com/package/aframe-material-collection/) for all UI components and interaction.
